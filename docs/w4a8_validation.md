# W4A8 验证与工具证据

本次环境：Windows PowerShell 5.1、Python 3.13.5、Vivado/XSim 2025.2（Build 6299465）。工具目录 E:\AMDDesignTools\2025.2\Vivado\bin。所有批处理通过 PowerShell & 调用，未修改全局环境或安装依赖。阶段二参考模型仅需 Python 标准库。

## 已复现的既有基线

原矩阵核心八组回归实际重跑通过：13矩阵/480输出每组，共3840输出；双缓冲单元18比较；NPU两组队列回归各36批任务+2恢复任务，共2382输出。原 RTL 未改动，已有综合/实现源哈希审计通过。原报告属于 INT8 matmul_top/npu_top，本阶段资源属于 w4a8_linear，不能混用。

## A：逐项位精确比较

| 配置 | 任务（含复位恢复） | 输出比较 | 分组psum比较 | 协议检查 | held input检查 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4x4_k8_g32_db | 38 | 621 | 1521 | 133473 | 3604 |
| 2x3_k5_g12_db | 38 | 621 | 3414 | 228580 | 6466 |
| 4x4_k8_g32_single | 38 | 621 | 1521 | 158120 | 3624 |

先通过单缓冲定向12任务/189输出/453 psum，随后三配置完整回归。每次运行均检查所有有效输出坐标、唯一性、数值及last；所有group psum同样比较。覆盖全部16种INT4编码的高/低nibble、INT8边界、零/正负、固定随机、M/N/K尾块、group跨tile、末组不足、明显不同scale、两种group/阵列、连续任务、忙时start拒绝、非法零尺寸、计算中复位及输出受阻时复位、暂停恢复、输入/request/output持稳、bank所有权、实际重叠、有效MAC及字节流量。

任务超时200000周期、全局20 ms watchdog、XSim Tcl最多20 ms；失败 $fatal，PowerShell另外检查PASS和失败日志，确保非零退出。故障注入状态：{"executed": true, "exit_code": 1}。

B：Q16.16反编码输出与理想未编码scale浮点量化参考比较，包括scale编码、输出舍入和饱和误差。C：浮点量化参考与原始浮点线性层比较。direct/zero/tie/saturation样例的原始浮点数据由反量化构造，C接近0是人为构造，真正量化误差看 kind=float 的 all_tails/decode/prefill/random_rect。两个group的量化张量不同，不应将数值差异直接归因于硬件。

## 器件级综合 / OOC

默认4×4/Ktile8/group32/双缓冲实际综合完成。Vivado 2025.2，part **xcvu9p-flga2104-2L-e** 为既有临时评估选择，未确认板卡、最终封装和速度等级。Latch=0、blackbox=0。配置见 build/synth_w4a8/configuration.txt。

完整资源/存储映射见 utilization_synth.rpt、utilization_hier_synth.rpt、ram_synth.rpt；乘法器实际DSP实例及 USE_MULT/USE_SIMD 见 dsp_mapping.txt；primitive_counts.txt 列出全部原语。RAM属性不是结果，实际推断以报告为准。默认实际22 DSP：16 PE、factor乘法1、宽psum×factor乘法4、valid_macs计数乘法1。scaled寄存器移除警告对应吸收到DSP的寄存器（dsp_mapping列出scaled_reg/ scaled_reg__0），不能把全部DSP当PE数量。packed W4当前符号扩展后复用8×8 MAC，未做一个DSP多个INT4乘法打包。group scratch及输出累加BRAM位利用率各2.78%，刻意保留同步BRAM行为，后续可比较小容量LUTRAM。

100 MHz是10 ns初步目标；综合时序不代表布线后频率。OOC假设虚拟 BUFGCE_X0Y0，未约束板级管脚和接口输入/输出延迟，报告存在无I/O延迟路径，应明确区别于无时钟或内部未约束端点。即使内部时序满足，也不作板级signoff或板上性能承诺。

## VCS与范围

Windows PATH/Get-Command、相关环境变量未发现VCS；WSL Ubuntu command -v vcs 及 /opt、/tools、/usr/local 常见 Synopsys目录探查无输出。未安装、未申请许可证、未运行VCS。提供可配置 Linux/WSL脚本 scripts/run_w4a8_vcs.sh，bash语法检查与VCS执行是两项不同检查，后者未验证。bash -n实际退出0，脚本可用性守卫实际返回 VCS_NOT_FOUND/退出2，未启动编译器；环境原始记录见 build/w4a8_environment.txt。XSim已经实际运行。

已实现并验证：本报告列出的W4A8功能及两组参数组合；默认配置器件综合/OOC状态如上。已实现但未验证：其他合法参数组合、最大64×64×4096实际任务、VCS编译执行。未来计划：DDR/DMA/PCIe、独立张量地址任务队列、INT8 requant、bias/FFN/Attention/完整模型。现有 NPU队列与新W4A8 top 尚未连接；保留两条可独立复现的顶层，避免宣称完整模型调度已实现。
