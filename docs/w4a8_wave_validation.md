# Group 内连续脉动波前：实际验证报告

新增w4a8_wave，保留w4a8_systolic逐tile排空与广播基线；systolic_pe/array及数值向量未改。Windows PowerShell5.1、Python3.13.5、Vivado/XSim2025.2 build6299465。临时评估part xcvu9p-flga2104-2L-e，板卡/最终封装与速度等级未确认。

合计409任务、11715输出、37773组psum和scaled乘积逐项一致。独立历史参考按逻辑advance编号存原始矩阵A/W，PE(r,c)取t−r−c的注入历史，逐PE逐拍比较fire与INT32 sum，包括WAIT_TILE/PRIME冻结。该参考不使用DUT乘积作为golden。

覆盖原15个数值/性能用例：零、边界、全部INT4编码、不同group scale、随机、非整块/不完整group、M=1/M>1、满8×8及尾块。额外强制输入饥饿使波前滞留在接缝20拍后恢复，以及接缝保持时复位恢复；原RUN/输出/post流水/末组排空复位、满psum队列、array/post/input暂停和输出背压均保留。旧bank重新LOADING写入时有在途波前的情况已覆盖。t4/t8所有CSV字段逐项复现上一轮s4/s8，包括暂停和恢复任务；原基线源码哈希一致。

每任务200000拍和全局20ms超时；自检失败fatal与脚本PASS检查转非零。自动错误golden探针：{"executed": true, "exit_code": 1}。只RTL仿真；综合网表仿真未运行。

## 数值三层

A：所有RTL输出/组psum/scaled乘积对位精确模型一致。B/C沿用相同向量，没有改量化算法；为合成浮点线性层，不是模型质量结论。满8×8 Prefill的实际参考误差：

默认tile8/group32、4×4/8×8 GROUP_STREAM=1运行器件工具，其他配置只仿真。两类RAM均为真实有限端口同步读，早释放bank没有新增RAM读写端口。每行512×64bit激活缓存实际RAMB36；W为LUTRAM；SRL单列，不能合计成RAM。DSP实例检查PE数量16/64，scale另计；latch/blackbox=0。10ns与虚拟BUFGCE_X0Y0仅内部OOC评估，无管脚/I/O delay；外部port不能据此报告板上频率。

## 范围与限制

已实现且验证：表中配置、逐PE对齐/冻结、流量和周期、bank重写/输入饥饿/复位；器件工具状态如上。未验证：最大M/N/K、未列参数、综合网表仿真、VCS编译运行。可配置VCS入口提供且Bash -n检查；本机未发现VCS，不安装或申请许可证。未来：消除READY tile的WAIT/PRIME边界停顿、有效槽psum保存、输出tile流水、Decode专用映射、统一NPU队列、DDR/完整模型。

“group连续”指同group不排空、不清除在途token，当前tile切换仍冻结两个固定控制拍，输入不READY还会增加冻结等待；不是每墙钟拍都注入，也未自动推进bubble以排空。新wave_hold统计是既有固定/输入等待周期的子集，不能重复加到总周期。数值格式与输出次序不变。
