# W4A8 跨列权重打包：实际验证与性能

本轮新增w4a8_packed，保留w4a8_stream和w4a8_linear及其回归/报告。数值、INT4 nibble次序和外部权重列优先存储不变，只改变tile数据包与权重bank字宽。工具：Windows PowerShell5.1、Python3.13.5、Vivado/XSim2025.2 Build6299465；VU9P part仍为xcvu9p-flga2104-2L-e临时评估选择，未确认板卡。模型仅需Python标准库。

每配置36正常任务+2复位恢复，所有有效输出和group psum完全等于原位精确参考。覆盖全部INT4编码、零/边界/正负/固定随机、M/N/K尾块、末group、跨tile累加、不同scale、暂停/背压、连续任务及计算中/输出受阻复位。keep逐字节独立检查，无效槽填0xA5；检查每拍有效bank写数与所有权。tile5/group12覆盖奇列数和奇K起点；tile19覆盖权重多32-bit字及A多64-bit字地址。超时200000周期/全局20ms，脚本检查fatal/PASS，失败非零退出。

PACK_COLS=0对照配置的所有模式、任务CSV周期和原有计数与上一轮w4a8_stream完全一致；新源与产物SHA256审计通过。故障注入：{"executed": true, "exit_code": 1}。量化三层A/B/C数值合同和误差未改变，见w4a8_numerics.md和w4a8_validation.md；没有真实模型准确率测量。

## 供数及计数口径

mode0：最多每拍一个64bit beat、无额外首延迟；mode1：每包首延迟5，每beat按8物理字节占用预算，beat之间7拍基础间隔+每8物理字节4拍burst间隔，padding也计预算；mode2：固定0x20261012 LFSR暂停、请求周期、首延迟及TB输入暂停/输出背压。各配置相同名义物理字节预算，但packet长度改变，随机握手时间线不同。只代表指定仿真模型，不代表DDR/板上性能。

valid_bytes=weight_bytes+activation_bytes+scale_bytes；physical_bytes=input_beats×BUS_BYTES；padding_bytes=physical_bytes−valid_bytes。compute/input_wait/output_wait互斥，overlap是compute子集，不可重复加总；计数32-bit无符号，每合法start清零，done后保持。有效MAC=m×n×k，尾填零不计入。峰值默认16MAC/拍、100MHz下理论1.6GMAC/s，未测板上吞吐。

默认4×4/tile8/group32/64bit/SCALE_ONCE1/PACK_COLS1已实际综合。Latch=0、blackbox=0；其余配置仅仿真。实际A/W存储映射见ram_synth.rpt，不能由RTL数组或RAM_STYLE直接命名。权重bank宽32bit、深度2，实际为160 LUTRAM；A仍64bit、深度1并映射FF。较上一版宽口综合3102FF/2141LUT，本版2335FF/2324LUT，减少767FF、增加183LUT。RAM/FF实现结果以报告为准。16个DSP用于PE，其余用于scale及MAC统计；没有改成脉动阵列，也没有打包多个乘法进一个DSP。
