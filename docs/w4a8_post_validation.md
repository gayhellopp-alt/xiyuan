# W4A8 双 psum Buffer 与独立 scale 流水：实际报告

新增w4a8_post；保留原w4a8_packed及其源哈希/报告。输入列对packet和数值合同未变，变化为两组group snapshot与独立后处理。工具为Windows PowerShell5.1/Python3.13.5/Vivado-XSim2025.2 Build6299465；part为xcvu9p-flga2104-2L-e临时评估选择，板卡未确认。

| one | 1 | 1 | 1×1/32 | 40 | 675 | 1683 | 24 | 5292 |

每配置36正常任务+4附加任务：计算中复位恢复、输出受阻复位恢复、后处理冻结至Buffer满后恢复、流水有数据时复位恢复。全输出和group INT32 psum逐项一致，并逐有效槽比较psum×sx×sw的64bit乘积。覆盖不同scale/group、尾块、GEMV/GEMM、INT4边界/全部编码、正负/随机/零、连续任务、输入暂停、输出背压、metadata、bank所有权、输出RAM读写仲裁、暂停时流水valid/tag/data持稳。1×1阵列专门覆盖单地址组间读写依赖。

超时每任务200000周期，全局20ms；fatal/PASS由PowerShell额外检查，失败非零。故障注入：{"executed": true, "exit_code": 1}。A位精确通过；量化B/C误差沿用同一向量与数值合同，见w4a8_validation.md，不代表真实模型准确率。

serial为新controller关闭流水/重叠，包含snapshot交付和独立控制的额外周期，不声称与旧单状态机周期完全一致。mode0连续beat；mode1保持上一轮物理字节预算及首延迟/burst；mode2仍有LFSR/输入/输出暂停，另加入周期post_pause。mode2与旧版暂停条件不同，不能将全部周期差归因于流水。

## 计数定义与端口约束

psum_groups：保存完整snapshot的组数；post_issue/retire：物理RC槽读请求/写回拍，包括尾槽0；预期均为output_tile_count×group_count×RC。compute_post_overlap：RUN且post状态活动，是RUN子集，post活动包括post_pause。post_active：P_STREAM状态周期；post_drain：核心WAIT_POST周期；psum_wait：WAIT_PSUM且目标bank非FREE。compute/input_wait/output_wait/psum_wait/post_drain互斥，不能将重叠指标或post_active重复加总。统计32位，每合法start清零，done后保持。另独立审计总周期闭式分类：固定开销=2RC×输出tile数+2×输入tile数+(RC+2)×group数+2MN+1，总周期=固定开销+RUN+input_wait+output_wait+psum_wait+post_drain。固定项涵盖初始化、同步读/交付、逐槽保存和输出，而不重复加post_active。

两个32bit psum RAM各单同步读/单写，64bit输出RAM单读/单写；后处理issue同步读psum/Y并寄存factor，下一enabled拍寄存scaled/Ybase，再下一拍写Y。流水每enabled拍一个slot，暂停整体冻结并禁止读写。仅一个group进入后处理，上一group最后写回后才取下一group，避免同地址组间RAW hazard；所有组完成才输出。CORE INIT_Y/OUT_REQ与后处理RAM访问互斥。每组仍用RC拍保存PE，未做PE双阵列。

有效MAC不计填零，默认16MAC/拍，100MHz目标的1.6GMAC/s是理论上限；供数/暂停来自TB，不代表DDR、板上频率或token/s。输入字节/beat/padding与旧版匹配，优化没有减少算法MAC或改变量化精度。

## VU9P 综合与内部时序

| 阶段 | LUT | FF | DSP | RAMB18 | RAMB36 | LUTRAM | URAM | WNS ns | WHS ns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 综合 | 2591.0 | 3029.0 | 22.0 | 2.0 | 1.0 | 160.0 | 0.0 | 6.264 | 0.071 |
| OOC | 2547.0 | 3029.0 | 22.0 | 2.0 | 1.0 | 160.0 | 0.0 | 4.401 | 0.01 |

默认4×4/group32/双输入bank/两psum bank/流水重叠已实际综合，latch=0、blackbox=0。其他配置只仿真。实际两组psum各映射RAMB18，输出累加RAMB36，W bank共160 LUTRAM，A bank为FF；相较旧列对综合，新增267 LUT、694 FF与1个RAMB18，DSP数量不变。浅psum RAM被工具建议改LUTRAM，本轮保留BRAM同步行为与对照，未做该额外优化。存储映射见ram_synth.rpt，DSP实际实例见dsp_mapping.txt。10ns约束和虚拟BUFGCE_X0Y0仅用于内部评估，无板级管脚/I/O延迟。

## 限制与后续

已实现且验证：表中七组合、位精确/乘积/ownership/压力/复位，默认综合/OOC状态如上。未验证：其他参数、最大逻辑尺寸、VCS编译执行。新VCS入口为run_w4a8_post_vcs.sh，仅Bash -n实际通过；编译执行未运行，未安装工具或申请许可证。两psum bank固定深度2；组间不同时在scale流水中，输出tile间未重叠；metadata与scale为FF，小RAM位利用率低。A跨N复用、专门Decode映射、脉动对照、NPU队列适配、真实DDR/DMA及完整Transformer仍未实现。

原始CSV/命令/source_inputs位于build/sim_w4a8_post_*，EDA在build/synth_w4a8_post，汇总build/w4a8_post_summary.json，接口/lifecycle见w4a8_post_architecture.md。
